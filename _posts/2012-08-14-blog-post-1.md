## My Experience at LAHacks 2024: Building Bike Buddy

### Inspiration
Our team was inspired by Track 3: "Touch Grass," which encouraged healthier living habits. We wanted to make an app that not only promoted a healthier lifestyle but made the process engaging and fun. That's how **Bike Buddy** was bornâ€”a program designed to help plan bike trips by pulling live weather and route information.

### What It Does
**Bike Buddy** is your biking companion that uses data from the **weather.api** and **Google Maps API** to plan your next bike trip based on current weather conditions and route options.

### How We Built It
I led the team and worked on the backend, using **Flask** to handle API calls and manage the server side, while our frontend was built with **React** to ensure a smooth and user-friendly interface. The combination of these technologies allowed us to create a polished, interactive experience for the user.

### Challenges We Ran Into
As this was our first hackathon, we faced some challenges, especially when trying to implement the **Gemini AI API**. It turned out to be more complex than we anticipated given the time constraints and our skill levels at the time. However, this only fueled our determination to focus on our core idea.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of
We successfully implemented our key concept: taking an input of a starting point (A) and a destination (B) to generate useful output (C) using the APIs. This was an essential building block for Bike Buddy and the first major milestone in our project.

### What We Learned
This experience taught us a lot about integrating different technologies. I gained a deeper understanding of how to make Python interact with external APIs, while also learning how **JavaScript** can pass data to Python via HTML arguments. It was a huge learning curve, but a rewarding one for the entire team.

### About Me & What I Learned

As the team lead, I took on the challenge of developing the entire backend for **Bike Buddy**, which involved integrating the various APIs and making sure everything functioned smoothly. Leading a team of 4, I quickly realized how crucial communication is in a fast-paced environment like a hackathon. I improved my communication skills by actively collecting feedback from each team member and ensuring that we all stayed aligned with our goals.

From a technical perspective, I deepened my knowledge of working with APIs, learning how to efficiently call and integrate them within a Python-based Flask framework. This experience highlighted the importance of balancing technical work with team management, and I grew in both areas over the course of the project.


### What's Next for Bike Buddy
Bike Buddy is just the beginning! We envision adding a backend database to store user data and trip history. This would allow users to revisit past routes and discover interesting aspects of previous trips. Additionally, with more time, we'd love to integrate **Google Gemini**, enabling features like a button that tells the user fun facts or scenic highlights about their selected route.
