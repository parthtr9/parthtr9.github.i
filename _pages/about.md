My name is Parth Trivedi, I am a sophmore at University of California San Diego pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I live in Eighth college and absolutely love the view from our buildings. I am really passionate about Computer Vision and it is one of the subjects that I wanna study more in detail about.
